# Sorting Algorithms in C#

This repository contains implementations of popular sorting algorithms in C# as part of the Algorithm Analysis course. The goal of this project is to understand the different sorting algorithms, their implementations, and their performance characteristics.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Insertion Sort**

## Algorithm Analysis
Each algorithm is implemented with explanations of the approach and its time and space complexity. The purpose of this repository is to study:
- **Time Complexity**: Understanding the performance of each algorithm under different conditions (best, worst, and average cases).
- **Space Complexity**: Analyzing the amount of memory required by each algorithm.
- **Practical Use Cases**: Discussing when each algorithm is most useful or efficient.

### Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n²)
- **Selection Sort**: O(n²)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n)
- **Quick Sort**: O(n log n) (on average), O(n²) (worst case)
- **Insertion Sort**: O(n²)

### Space Complexity
- **Bubble Sort**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
- **Selection Sort**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n) (additional space for merging)
- **Quick Sort**: O(log n) (average case)
- **Insertion Sort**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
