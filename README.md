# Sorting Algorithms in C#

This repository contains implementations of popular sorting algorithms in C# as part of the Algorithm Analysis course. The goal of this project is to understand the different sorting algorithms, their implementations, and their performance characteristics.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

### Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)
- **Insertion Sort**: O(nÂ²)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity
- **Insertion Sort**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n) (additional space for merging)

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YavuzSametKan/sorting-algorithms.git
